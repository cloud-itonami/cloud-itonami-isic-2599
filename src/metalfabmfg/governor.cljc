  "Metal Fabrication Plant Operations Governor -- the independent
  compliance layer that earns the MetalFabAdvisor the right to commit.
  The advisor has no notion of whether a piece of equipment it wants to
  schedule maintenance against has actually been inspected/registered,
  whether a batch it wants to coordinate a shipment against has
  actually been QC-verified/registered, whether a maintenance proposal
  secretly tries to ACTUATE (rather than merely draft-schedule) the
  stamping press or pressing/wire-forming line, whether a shipment
  proposal's own claimed weight would blow through the batch's own
  logged production weight, or when an act stops being a coordination
  proposal and becomes direct stamping/pressing-line-equipment
  control, so this MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a
  proposal and fall back to HOLD.

  `:itonami.blueprint/governor` is
  `:metal-fab-plant-operations-governor` (see
  docs/adr/0001-architecture.md).

  Checks below, ALL HARD violations except the confidence/high-stakes
  gate (SOFT -- asks a human to look, and the human may approve):

    1. Request-level propose-only  -- did the CALLER's own request
                                       actually declare `:effect
                                       :propose`? Any other value is a
                                       mis-wired/compromised caller
                                       trying to bypass proposal-only
                                       mode -- HARD, unconditional,
                                       evaluated BEFORE anything else.
    2. Closed op allowlist         -- is `:op` one of the four ops this
                                       actor is authorized to coordinate?
                                       Anything else -- HARD hold.
    3. Closed effect allowlist     -- is the PROPOSAL's own `:effect`
                                       (what would actually commit) one
                                       of the four propose-shaped
                                       effects? A proposal effect
                                       outside this set (e.g. a
                                       hallucinated `:press-line/
                                       actuate` or `:wire-former/run`)
                                       is the 'direct stamping/
                                       pressing-line-equipment control'
                                       scope violation this actor must
                                       NEVER perform -- HARD, PERMANENT,
                                       unconditional.
    4. Press-line-actuate blocked  -- for `:schedule-maintenance`, does
                                       the proposal's own `:value`
                                       declare `:actuate-press-line?
                                       true`? Directly actuating the
                                       stamping press or pressing/wire-
                                       forming line is this actor's
                                       other permanent scope boundary
                                       (see README `What this actor
                                       does NOT do`) -- HARD, PERMANENT,
                                       unconditional. NO phase and NO
                                       human approval can ever override
                                       this (see `metalfabmfg.phase`:
                                       this op is never a member of any
                                       phase's `:auto` set either -- two
                                       independent layers agree).
    5. Equipment not verified/
       registered                  -- for `:schedule-maintenance`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY verify the
                                       referenced equipment's own
                                       `:verified?` AND `:registered?`
                                       are both true
                                       (`metalfabmfg.registry/equipment-
                                       ready?`) -- never trust the
                                       advisor's own rationale about
                                       verification/registration
                                       status. Grounded in this
                                       blueprint's own HARD invariant
                                       ('shop/batch record must be
                                       independently verified/

                                       maintenance must never be
                                       scheduled against equipment
                                       whose own conditions have not
                                       actually been inspected or
                                       whose registration is not
                                       actually on file.
    6. Already scheduled           -- for `:schedule-maintenance`,
                                       refuses to schedule the SAME
                                       maintenance record twice, off a
                                       dedicated `:scheduled?` fact
                                       (never a `:status` value).
    7. Batch not verified/
       registered                  -- for `:coordinate-shipment`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY verify the
                                       referenced batch's own
                                       `:verified?` AND `:registered?`
                                       are both true
                                       (`metalfabmfg.registry/batch-
                                       ready?`) -- never trust the
                                       advisor's own rationale. Also
                                       part of the 'shop/batch record'
                                       HARD invariant: a batch's own
                                       verified/registered status is as
                                       much a ground-truth fact as an
                                       equipment unit's own.
    8. Shipment weight exceeded    -- for `:coordinate-shipment`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY recompute whether
                                       the batch's own recorded
                                       `:shipped-weight-kg` plus
                                       the proposal's own claimed
                                       `:weight-kg` would exceed
                                       the batch's own recorded
                                       `:weight-kg`
                                       (`metalfabmfg.registry/shipment-
                                       weight-exceeded?`) -- ground
                                       truth from the batch's own
                                       permanent fields, never a
                                       self-reported weight claim.
    9. Invalid product-category    -- for `:log-production-batch`, if
                                       the patch declares a
                                       `:product-category` outside the
                                       closed known set

                                       record is rejected rather than
                                       let a fabricated product
                                       category through.

                                       `:defect-rate-percent` that is
                                       not a physically plausible

                                       is rejected rather than let

                                       through.
   11. Confidence floor / high-
       stakes gate                  -- LLM confidence below threshold,
                                       OR the proposal's own `:stake` is

  Addendum (superproject part-supplier-linkage ADR, cloud-itonami-
  isic-2599<->cloud-itonami-isic-2813): a TWELFTH HARD check,
  `handoff-incomplete-violations`, was added alongside an OPTIONAL
  `:handoff` field on `:coordinate-shipment` (the superproject
  `:handoff` shared shape, ADR-2607177600, reused as-is -- no new
  shape). `:handoff` names which downstream consumer (e.g.
  cloud-itonami-isic-2813, sourcing `part:piping`/`part:vibration-
  isolators` fabricated-metal components) the shipped batch is
  destined for; unlike isic-1075's own `:coordinate-shipment` (which
  made `:handoff` MANDATORY), this actor's `:handoff` stays OPTIONAL
  -- a shipment with NO `:handoff` at all is NOT a violation, but a
  `:handoff` that IS present and missing any of its own three
  identity/correlation fields (`registry/handoff-fields-present?`)
  HARD-holds."
